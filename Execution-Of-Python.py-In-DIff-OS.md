# MAC Terminal Execution
  
    Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs. A good suggestion would be to name it pythonpractice and place it in your Home folder (the one that contains folders for Documents, Movies, Music, Pictures, etc). Save your hello.py program into this folder.
    Open the Applications folder, go into the Utilities folder, and open the Terminal program.
    Type cd pythonpractice to change directory to your pythonpractice folder, and hit Enter.
    Type python ./zomatoNegativeFeedback.py to run your program!
    
# Windows Command Prompt Execution

    Type cd \pythonpractice to change directory to your pythonpractice folder, and hit Enter.
    Type zomatoNegativeFeedback.py to run your program!
   
   If it didn't work, make sure your PATH contains the python directory. See [Getting Python.](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Getting_Python)
